## Week 2 – Level‑0
Used ChatGPT to draft V-themed greeting/exit lines. Manually integrated and tested.
Observation: Faster copy tweaks; kept logic simple to meet minimal spec.

## Week 3 – Level‑1
Enhanced V with echo functionality using clean code practices:
- Refactored code into logical methods (showLogo, greet, echo, farewell)
- Added Javadoc comments for all methods
- Implemented main input loop with 'bye' condition
- Added proper error handling and resource management
- Maintained V's theatrical personality in all output

AI Usage: Used AI to help structure the code following clean code principles and Java best practices. Manually implemented all logic and verified behavior.
